Primer Proyecto

Creation of my first project, a recipe page, I have to apply what I have learned in HTML.

- I also learned how to use the basic HTML tags like the image, the unordered lists, the ordered lists and the links, especially the relative ones! 
- With this project, I learned to master the basics of HTML and learned how to structure a web page.
